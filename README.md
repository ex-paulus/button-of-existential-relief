# button-of-existential-relief

A single button to make everything slightly less existentially f***ed.  
Modes include: mild advice, emotional SOS, passive resistance, and The Dude abides.

## What is this?

A small web-based app built to give you a short phrase of support, clarity, or at least something vaguely reassuring — depending on your mood.

It’s not productivity. It’s not AI. It’s... a button.

---

## Modes:

- **Just Advice** — generic internet wisdom.
- **SOS** — raw, punchy encouragement when the world is on fire.
- **I’m Good** — affirmations for when you actually feel okay.
- **Smoke Signal** — no words, just “you’re still here, and that’s enough.”

## Local run

1. Clone this repo
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python app.py`
4. Open `http://localhost:5000` and press the button.

## Contribute?

Absolutely. Add your own modes, phrases, or redesigns.  
Because this button belongs to everyone who needs to pause and breathe.
